DraggablePanel: https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel

The DraggablePanel included in this sample is a modified version of the DraggablePanel library so that it can be used in Eclipse and without dependency on nine-old-android.  I have also added a callback to capture the scale of the dragView as the user performs the minimize/maximize gesture.
